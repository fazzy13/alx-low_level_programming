## Description
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate file input/output operations using system calls like `open`, `close`, `read`, `write`, and `lseek`, as well as functions for file manipulation.

## Files
- **0-read_textfile.c:** A function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
- **1-create_file.c:** A function that creates a file.
- **2-append_text_to_file.c:** A function that appends text at the end of a file.
- **3-cp.c:** A program that copies the content of a file to another file.
- **100-elf_header.c:** A program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.

## Compilation and Usage
- The programs are compiled using the following flags:

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <source_file.c> -o <output_file>`

- Run the compiled program using:

`./<output_file>`

- Usage instructions for each program are provided in the respective program's description.

## Requirements
- The programs are written in C and compiled using `gcc`.
- The code is compliant with the Betty style.
